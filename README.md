# üß¨ Endangered Species Genome Bank (ESGB)

## Overview

The Endangered Species Genome Bank (ESGB) is a groundbreaking blockchain-powered platform designed to preserve, protect, and study the genetic information of endangered species through cutting-edge decentralized technologies.

## Project Vision

Our mission is to leverage blockchain, web3, and decentralized computing to:
- Preserve genetic diversity of endangered species
- Facilitate global scientific collaboration
- Create sustainable funding mechanisms for conservation efforts
- Enable transparent and secure genetic research

## Key Features

### 1. Genetic Sequence NFTs üî¨
- Unique Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) representing individual species' genetic sequences
- Immutable genetic record on the blockchain
- Provenance tracking for genetic data

### 2. Smart Contract Ecosystem üìú
- Granular access controls for genetic research
- Automated research collaboration agreements
- Transparent royalty and credit distribution mechanisms

### 3. Conservation Funding Model üí∞
- Tokenized funding streams for conservation projects
- Direct community investment in species preservation
- Transparent tracking of fund utilization

### 4. Decentralized Genomic Computing üñ•Ô∏è
- Distributed computational network for genomic analysis
- Synthetic biology simulation capabilities
- Secure, privacy-preserving computational resources

### 5. Wildlife Population Tracking üåç
- Real-time integration with wildlife tracking systems
- Genetic health monitoring
- Population trend analysis

## Technology Stack
